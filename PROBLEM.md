## Problem Statement: Understanding Custom Functional Interface, Generic and Lambda expression ##

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, two lambda expressions should be written for the following functionality using the same functional interface
            
            Given an input String should return the string in changed case
            Given an input number should return the cube of that number
            
       
## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
